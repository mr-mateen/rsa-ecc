# RSA and ECC in JavaScript

### Source
http://www-cs-students.stanford.edu/~tjw/jsbn/

## Core Library
* jsbn.js - basic BigInteger implementation, just enough for RSA encryption and not much more.
* jsbn2.js - the rest of the library, including most public BigInteger methods.

## RSA
* rsa.js - implementation of RSA encryption, does not require jsbn2.js.
* rsa2.js - rest of RSA algorithm, including decryption and keygen.

## ECC
ec.js - elliptic curve math, depends on both jsbn.js and jsbn2.js
sec.js - standard elliptic curve parameters

## Utilities
* rng.js - rudimentary entropy collector and RNG interface, requires a PRNG backend to define prng_newstate().
* prng4.js - ARC4-based PRNG backend for rng.js, very small.
* base64.js - Base64 encoding and decoding routines.
* sha1.js - SHA-1 hash function, only needed for IBE demo.
